Hotfin is a real estate web app inspired by Redfin. While it’s not jam-packed with features, the opportunity exists to expand. We’ll use this app as a jumping-off point for getting more familiar with Hotwire. 

## Setup

1. Clone the repo down.
2. Run `bundle install` and `yarn install`.
3. `./bin/rails db:create db:migrate db:seed`

Git branches on the repo pertain to each lesson in the build-along. Follow my lead in the videos as we navigate together on [hellohotwire.com](https://hellohotwire.com)
